Sci-ModoM: The quantitative database of transcriptome-wide high-throughput RNA modification sites
=================================================================================================

Introduction
------------

`Sci-ModoM <https://scimodom.dieterichlab.org>`_ is a quantitative database of RNA modifications dedicated to novel assays that provide transcriptome-wide information at single-base resolution.

The user guide is primarily intended to serve as a maintainer's documentation and to assist developers in familiarizing with the data model. It also serves
as a detailed resource for users who need in-depth information.

This is the official documentation for the bedRMod format specification.
